During my data science internship at Prodigy, I successfully completed Task One, which focused on creating visualizations to analyze the distribution of population data. The main objective was to develop a bar chart or histogram to illustrate the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender within a population.

To achieve this, I examined a comprehensive world population dataset and plotted bar graphs representing the top 50 countries by population for the years 2010, 2011, 2020, and 2021. This analysis provided a clear visual representation of population trends over time, allowing for easy comparisons among the leading populated nations.

Additionally, I created a bar graph that specifically highlighted the top 15 countries with the highest male and female populations. This visualization enabled a deeper understanding of gender distribution across these countries.

Furthermore, I developed a stacked plot that showcased the population dynamics of both the top and bottom populated countries. This plot effectively illustrated the stark contrasts in population sizes, providing valuable insights into global population distribution.

Overall, this task not only enhanced my data visualization skills but also deepened my understanding of population dynamics, which are essential in the field of data science.
